// TestHarnessIdentityIsSelfConsistent pins every place this wrapper commits to a
// harness identity to a single value: the harness this checkout actually is.
//
//	checkout directory name        which harness this repo is
//	module path in go.mod          who we are as a Go package
//	msg.HarnessBinaryName(harness) the binary name llm-bridge-server resolves on PATH
//	BIN_NAME in deploy.sh          what ./deploy.sh builds, installs and restarts
//
// These are independent constants. Every wrapper in this family was created by
// cloning an existing one, which copies them all verbatim, and any one left
// un-retargeted silently points this harness at a different harness: it answers
// to that harness's name on the bus, or overwrites its installed binary. Three
// of these four shipped wrong in llm-bridge-copilotcli (a claudecode clone) and
// none was caught by a build or a test, because the wrong values all agreed with
// each other — only the checkout directory disagreed, which is why it is the
// anchor here.
//
// Wrappers that carry a state.db (claudecode, codex, jig) pin its directory too;
// this one holds no session-chain state, so there is no state leg to check.
//
// The anchor is the name of the repository's MAIN working tree, not of the
// directory the test happens to run in. Those differ inside a linked git
// worktree, and taking the running directory there made this test report every
// leg wrong against a tree that was entirely correct: a worktree named
// llm-bridge-<harness>-wt-<topic> satisfies the llm-bridge- prefix, so the skip
// below did not fire and each constant was compared against the worktree's name.
// A test that cries wolf wherever you work is one a reader learns to ignore, and
// this test exists to catch a clone that was never re-targeted.
