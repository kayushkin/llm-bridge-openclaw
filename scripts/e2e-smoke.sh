# Boot-and-answer smoke test for llm-bridge-openclaw.
#
# Builds the harness from THIS checkout and proves the resulting binary can
# actually BOOT and ANSWER. `go build` passing proves nothing of the sort: a
# harness that panics on startup is exactly as dead as a server that does — it
# just fails at session-spawn time instead of at boot, where nobody is looking.
#
# What this harness's -discover does:
#   -discover walks OpenClaw's on-disk tree at $OPENCLAW_DIR/agents/<agent>/
#   sessions/, resolving each <uuid>.jsonl to a session name through that
#   agent's sessions.json, and emits the canonical `agent:<agent>:main` session
#   as harness_session_id `<agent>:main`. It deliberately leaves
#   bridge_session_id EMPTY so bridge-server's adoption path can mint the chain
#   head — a harness must never invent a bridge id (see the session-id contract).
#
# Three things are asserted, because a harness CLI has three entrypoints and a
# green build covers none of them:
#
#   1. -discover      emits a well-formed JSON ARRAY on stdout and exits 0.
#                     This is the contract bridge-server parses at boot; `null`
#                     (a nil slice encoded straight out) or a stray log line on
#                     stdout would both break it while compiling perfectly.
#   2. the main loop  boots the production JSON-RPC path and shuts down cleanly when stdin closes.
#   3. the sandbox    is honoured — see below.
#
# HERMETICITY IS AN ASSERTION HERE, NOT A PRECAUTION.
# The harness resolves its own state and session paths from $HOME. This smoke
# points HOME at a throwaway directory and then CHECKS that the harness wrote
# there and not to the live tree — an audit that can damage what it audits is
# worse than no audit. PATH is curated down to the system dirs for the same
# reason: several harnesses exec their upstream CLI (the OpenClaw server), and a smoke
# whose result depends on which CLIs happen to be installed on the box is not a
# guard, it is a coin flip.
#
# Exits 0 on success, non-zero on the first failing assertion.
#
# Tunables:
#   E2E_KEEP  — set to "1" to leave $TMP_DIR around after the run
